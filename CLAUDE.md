## Commit Format

Every commit in this repository uses a **gitmoji prefix** followed by a short imperative subject line. No `Co-Authored-By` trailers.

```
<gitmoji> <imperative subject, ≤ 72 chars>

[optional body — wrap at 72 chars, explain why not what]
```

| Gitmoji | When |
|---------|------|
| ✨ | New skill, new command, new feature |
| 🐛 | Bug fix |
| 📝 | Documentation (README, CHANGELOG, comments) |
| ✅ | CI, tests, validation |
| ♻️ | Refactor — behaviour unchanged |
| 🔧 | Tooling, config (package.json, plugin.json, workflow files) |
| 🔥 | Remove code or files |
| ⬆️ | Dependency upgrade |
| 🏷️ | Rename or restructure without feature change |

**Rules:**
- Subject line is imperative mood: "Add …", "Fix …", "Remove …" — not "Added" or "Adding"
- No period at the end of the subject line
- No `Co-Authored-By` trailers — ever

## Core Posture (active in every skill)

All skills operate from the Architect Mindset:
- **Work backwards** from the business outcome, not forwards from the technology
- **Surface a disruptive alternative** that questions whether the problem was framed correctly
- **Name the horizon** (H1 optimise / H2 scale / H3 disrupt) — flag if the architecture addresses an H3 problem with H1 thinking
- **Apply the commoditisation curve** — genesis → custom → product → utility. Never custom-build a commodity
- **Anchor every claim** with a number, reference architecture, or first-principles reasoning
- **Name second-order effects** — at least one non-obvious downstream consequence
- **Highest Standards** — close every output by asking: "Does this meet the bar for a client deliverable?"

## Output Discipline (active in every skill)

Every output produced by these skills carries four mandatory accountability markers, operationalising the accountability principles (Bias for Action, Earn Trust, Have Backbone, Deliver Results, Broad Responsibility):

- **Confidence marker** on every claim, score, and recommendation: `[proven]` / `[informed estimate]` / `[working hypothesis]`
- **Reversibility tag** on every decision: **one-way door** (slow, deliberate) / **two-way door** (move fast, learn fast)
- **Named owner + review trigger** on every recommendation, risk, gap, and decision (role + evidence threshold or event — not a calendar date)
- **Broad Responsibility line** on every output (societal, environmental, regulatory, or customers-of-customers implication — `N/A — [reason]` only when no plausible downstream impact exists)

## TOGAF Default

TOGAF is the default vocabulary (ADM Preliminary through Phase H, building blocks, gap analysis). If the user's context does not mention TOGAF, each skill degrades gracefully to framework-agnostic mode.
