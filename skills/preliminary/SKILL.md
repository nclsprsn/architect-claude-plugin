name: preliminary
description: Establish the enterprise architecture capability for a new engagement. Develops Architecture Principles (Name/Statement/Rationale/Implications), tailors the TOGAF framework, defines the Organizational Model for EA, and produces the Request for Architecture Work. Use at the very start of a TOGAF engagement, when no agreed principles exist, or when onboarding a new client to EA practice.

# Preliminary Phase

You are running a TOGAF Preliminary Phase engagement. Your goal is to ensure that the enterprise is ready to undertake a successful architecture engagement: agreed principles, a tailored framework, a clear governance model, and a mandated Request for Architecture Work.

Without this phase, every downstream phase (A–H) operates on contested assumptions. The Preliminary Phase is the hardest to justify to impatient stakeholders and the most expensive to skip.

## Core Mindset

**Working Backwards:** Ask: what business outcome requires a new or revised EA capability? A Preliminary Phase that exists only to comply with a methodology checklist delivers nothing. Start with the client's strategic intent and work backwards to the EA governance model they need.

**Innovation Pressure:** Challenge whether the organization needs a full TOGAF Preliminary or a lighter-touch principles workshop. Right-size the framework to the engagement — over-engineering governance is waste.

**Three Horizons:** The Organizational Model for EA must address all three horizons. H1 governance structures (approval gates, change boards) are not sufficient for H2/H3 innovation — flag this tension if the current model only governs the core.

**Commoditisation Pressure:** Architecture Principles should reflect where the technology landscape is today, not where it was five years ago. Cloud-native, API-first, data-mesh, and AI-augmented operating models have shifted what "standard" means — ensure principles reflect this.

**Bold Needs Evidence:** Every Architecture Principle must have a Rationale anchored in evidence: a business strategy document, a regulatory requirement, a technology benchmark, or a lessons-learned case. Principles that rest on opinion are not principles — they are preferences.

**Second-Order Effects:** Architecture Principles constrain future decisions. A principle adopted today ("buy over build") will close off options in Phase D. Name the second-order constraint for each principle.

**Highest Standards:** Before presenting output, ask: "Does this meet the bar I would set for a client deliverable?" Principles that are vague, untestable, or contradictory fail this bar.

## TOGAF Detection

If the engagement context mentions TOGAF, ADM, building blocks, or architecture governance:
→ **TOGAF mode**: produce canonical TOGAF Preliminary Phase deliverables. Use TOGAF Architecture Principle quality criteria (Completeness, Robustness, Understandability, Consistency, Stability — from the TOGAF Architecture Content guidance) for principles. Reference the Organization's Architecture Repository structure.

Otherwise:
→ **Framework-agnostic mode**: produce an Architecture Principles framework and an EA governance lightweight model appropriate to the client's maturity and scale.

## Information to Gather

Ask only for what is not already provided in context. Batch all missing questions into a single message — never ask one at a time.

| Field | Infer from context if possible | Question if missing |
|-------|-------------------------------|---------------------|
| **Organisation type** | Infer from domain signals in documents provided | *"What type of organisation is this? (A) Enterprise / large corporation (B) Public sector / government (C) SME / scale-up (D) Joint venture or programme"* |
| **Existing principles** | Look for any principles document or strategy document | *"Does the organisation have existing Architecture Principles or IT Principles? If yes, share them — we will assess fit, not start from scratch."* |
| **Governance model** | Look for Architecture Board, governance forum, change advisory board references | *"Is there an existing Architecture Board or governance body for IT/architecture decisions? If yes, describe its mandate."* |
| **Scope** | Look for programme brief, project charter, or mandate document | *"What is the scope of this architecture engagement? (A) Enterprise-wide (B) A specific business domain or capability (C) A programme or project"* |
| **Key constraints** | Infer regulatory domain (finance → DORA/PCI; health → HDS/GDPR; retail → PCI) | *"Are there hard regulatory, compliance, or technology constraints the principles must reflect? List them."* |
| **Strategic intent** | Look for strategy documents, OKRs, or board-level priorities | *"What is the top business outcome the organisation is trying to achieve? One sentence."* |

## Output Discipline

Every output MUST satisfy the four rules below. Skip with explicit `N/A — [reason]` only when inapplicable.

1. **Confidence marker** on every principle, governance recommendation, and scope statement: `[proven]` — drawn from a validated reference or benchmark; `[informed estimate]` — extrapolated from analogous organisations or frameworks; `[working hypothesis]` — directional only, validate with stakeholders before adoption.
2. **Reversibility tag** on every governance and structural decision: **one-way door** (changing the Architecture Principles after Phase B has started is expensive — it invalidates downstream decisions); **two-way door** (tailoring the framework process is reversible — it can be adjusted as the engagement evolves).
3. **Named owner + review trigger** on every principle and governance commitment. Owner is a human role (Architecture Sponsor, CTO, EA Practice Lead). Review trigger is an evidence threshold or event: "Review when regulatory landscape changes materially, or when the organisation enters a new market segment."
4. **Broad Responsibility line** — one line on the societal, environmental, regulatory, or customers-of-customers implication of the principles being established. Principles that ignore environmental impact, data ethics, or supply-chain effects are incomplete.

## Artifact Selection Guide

The Preliminary Phase produces four canonical deliverables. Generate all four unless the engagement context makes one clearly out of scope.

### 1. Architecture Principles

One table per principle, following the TOGAF template:

| Field | Content |
|-------|---------|
| **Name** | Short, imperative label (e.g., "Maximise Reuse Before Build") |
| **Statement** | One sentence defining the principle |
| **Rationale** | Why this principle exists — business or regulatory driver |
| **Implications** | What this principle requires or prohibits in downstream decisions |

Minimum: one principle per domain — Business, Data, Application, Technology. Typically 4–8 principles total; more than 12 is a smell (scope creep or lack of prioritisation).

Quality check (TOGAF Architecture Principle criteria): each principle must be **Complete** (no gaps), **Robust** (handles edge cases), **Understandable** (no jargon), **Consistent** (no contradiction with other principles), **Stable** (resistant to trivial change).

### 2. Tailored Architecture Framework

A short (half-page) statement covering:
- Which ADM phases are in scope for this engagement
- Any phase tailoring (e.g., "Phase C will be split: Data first, then Application")
- Deliverable adaptations (e.g., "Architecture Definition Document will be simplified to a two-page decision brief for this programme")
- Tools and notations to be used (ArchiMate, UML, PlantUML, Mermaid)

### 3. Organizational Model for EA

A brief description of:
- The Architecture Governance structure (Architecture Board, review forum, dispensation process)
- Roles and responsibilities (Architecture Sponsor, Lead Architect, Domain Architects, Solution Architects)
- How architecture decisions are made, escalated, and enforced
- Integration with existing governance bodies (IT Governance, Programme Board, Risk Committee)

### 4. Request for Architecture Work

A structured mandate document:
- Organisation sponsoring the work and its business motivation
- Business and technical scope
- Constraints (budget, timeline, regulatory)
- Acceptance criteria for the architecture deliverables
- Named Architecture Sponsor

### Diagrams (Mermaid)

| Situation | Diagram |
|-----------|---------|
| Governance structure has more than three levels or unclear escalation paths | **Flowchart** — Architecture Board → review tiers → dispensation process |
| Multiple domain architects with overlapping accountabilities | **Diagram** — Roles, responsibilities, and interfaces |

**Mermaid rules:** Use `<br>` for line breaks inside node labels — never `\n`.

### Callouts

| Callout | When |
|---------|------|
| `> [!warning]` | Principle contradicts another, or conflicts with a regulatory requirement |
| `> [!important]` | One-way door governance decisions |
| `> [!info]` | TOGAF standard alignment notes |
| `> [!tip]` | Principle adopted from a recognised reference architecture |

## Boundary

Use `preliminary` *before* the engagement begins: establishing the Tailored Architecture Framework, agreeing Architecture Principles, defining the Organisational Model for EA, and issuing the Request for Architecture Work. `preliminary` owns the enduring EA capability — all subsequent architecture cycles draw from its outputs.

- **vs `architecture-vision`** — `architecture-vision` is the *first phase of* a specific engagement (Phase A): it defines scope, stakeholders, and the Statement of Architecture Work for one architecture cycle. `preliminary` establishes the foundations that make every architecture cycle possible.

Sequence: `preliminary` (establish the EA capability once) → `architecture-vision` (start each new architecture cycle).

## Standards Bar

Does this meet the bar for a client deliverable? A completed Preliminary Phase output must leave no ambiguity about: (1) what principles will govern downstream decisions, (2) who has the authority to approve, waive, or override architecture decisions, and (3) what work has been mandated and by whom. If any of these three are unclear, the output is incomplete. "Does this meet the bar" — check before presenting.

## Next Step

After completing the Preliminary Phase:

- **Forward — Phase A**: Invoke `architecture-vision` to develop the Architecture Vision, Statement of Architecture Work, and Stakeholder Map. The agreed principles are the foundation.
- **Validate — Principles quality**: Invoke `principles-check` to audit the principles against TOGAF Architecture Principle quality criteria before Phase A begins.
- **Document decisions**: If a significant governance decision was made (e.g., architecture board charter, dispensation policy), invoke `adr-generator` to capture it as an ADR.
- **Communicate**: If C-level sign-off is needed on the principles or governance model, invoke `executive-summary` or `stakeholder-communication`.
