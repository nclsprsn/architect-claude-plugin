# Worked TOGAF Artefact Examples

Concrete, populated TOGAF artefacts you can adapt for your own engagement. Every file is anchored to the same fictional **ACME Corp Customer Onboarding modernisation** engagement so the dependencies between artefacts are visible — the same capability names, metric values, and role names appear consistently across all eight files.

---

## Shared Scenario — ACME Corp Customer Onboarding

| Element | Value |
|---------|-------|
| Organisation | ACME Corp — generic mid-size enterprise, ~5,000 employees, hybrid cloud baseline |
| Engagement name | Customer Onboarding Modernisation — Phase 1 |
| Architecture Sponsor | Chief Customer Officer (Sarah Chen) |
| Lead Architect | Head of Enterprise Architecture (Marcus Webb) |
| Business driver | Reduce average onboarding cycle from **11 days → ≤3 days**; retire end-of-life CRM module; meet tightened identity-verification regulatory requirement |
| Horizon | H2 — scale emerging (~3-year roadmap) |
| Hard constraints | Regulatory data-protection regime; €12M capex ceiling; existing approved cloud platform |
| Out of scope | HR systems, Finance ERP, in-store / branch operations |

### Coherence thread

The principle **"Adopt Commodity Before Building Custom"** (established in the Architecture Principles) is:
- cited as a constraint in the ARS,
- the deciding factor in the ADR,
- a compliance gate in the Architecture Contract, and
- assessed as *Conformant* in the Compliance Assessment.

This chain is intentional — follow it across files to see how TOGAF artefacts accumulate rather than repeat.

## How to Adapt These Examples

1. **Replace role names** (Sarah Chen, Marcus Webb, Priya Sharma, Tom Hayward, David Okafor) with your actual stakeholders.
2. **Replace capability names** with those from your Phase B Capability Assessment.
3. **Replace the success metric** (11-day → ≤3-day cycle) with your actual baseline and target.
4. **Replace the regulatory reference** ("generic data-protection regime") with the specific regulation applicable to your engagement.
5. **Replace "ACME approved cloud platform"** with your organisation's approved platform.
6. Keep the **structure and discipline markers** unchanged — they are the part the Architecture Board will scrutinise.

## Discipline Markers

Every artefact in this set uses the four mandatory output-discipline markers as **table columns or explicit rows**, not prose:

| Marker | Where used |
|--------|-----------|
| `[proven]` / `[informed estimate]` / `[working hypothesis]` | Every capability maturity score, requirement, finding |
| **one-way door** / **two-way door** | Every scope decision, architecture direction, constraint |
| Named owner + review trigger | Every principle, requirement, and compliance finding |
| **Broad Responsibility** | Closing line of every artefact covering societal/regulatory/customers-of-customers impact |
