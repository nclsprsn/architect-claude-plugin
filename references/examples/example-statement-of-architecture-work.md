# Example — Statement of Architecture Work

**Engagement:** ACME Corp Customer Onboarding Modernisation
**Version:** 1.0 — For Architecture Sponsor signature
**Template:** TOGAF 10 Pocket Guide §7.6 — Statement of Architecture Work (9 clauses)
**Produced by skill:** `architecture-vision`

> [!info]
> The SoAW is the contract between the architecture team and its sponsor for a single architecture cycle. It consumes the outputs of the RfAW (`example-request-for-architecture-work.md`) and governs all Phase B–G deliverables that follow. Without a signed SoAW the architecture work has no agreed scope and no mechanism to resist scope change. This example follows the 9-clause §7.6 template defined in `skills/architecture-vision/SKILL.md`.

### 2 — Project Request / Terms of Reference

The Customer Division of ACME Corp has identified that the current Customer Onboarding process is a material constraint on customer acquisition growth. The average onboarding cycle of **11 working days** (Q2 2024 Operations Report) results in a 23% customer abandonment rate (ACME CX Research Q3 2024). The CRM module at the core of the onboarding workflow reaches vendor end-of-life in Q4 2025, and a regulatory directive issued in Q1 2024 requires identity verification to meet a higher assurance standard.

This Statement of Architecture Work is issued under the authority of the signed Request for Architecture Work (ACME-RfAW-2024-001) and mandates the Enterprise Architecture practice to develop, govern, and validate the Target Architecture for the Customer Onboarding Modernisation programme.

| Confidence | Reversibility | Owner | Review trigger |
|------------|---------------|-------|----------------|
| `[proven]` — grounded in signed RfAW and referenced operational data | two-way door at draft stage; one-way door once signed by Architecture Sponsor | Head of Enterprise Architecture (Marcus Webb) | Reopen if programme mandate changes or a new regulatory directive supersedes the Q1 2024 requirement |

### 3 — Scope

**In scope:**
- End-to-end Customer Onboarding process: initial application → identity verification → data capture → risk scoring → account activation
- Systems: Legacy CRM (onboarding module only), Identity Verification Service, Document Capture Service, Customer Master Data system, Notification Service, Customer Identity and Access Management (CIAM) platform
- Organisational units: Customer Operations, IT Operations, Information Security, Legal & Compliance
- Architecture domains: Business (Phase B), Data and Application (Phase C), Technology (Phase D)
- Governance phases: Opportunities & Solutions (Phase E), Migration Planning (Phase F), Implementation Governance (Phase G)

**Explicitly out of scope:**

> [!warning]
> The following items are out of scope. Stakeholders may assume some are included — they are not. Scope changes require a formal SoAW revision.

- HR systems and Finance ERP
- In-store and branch onboarding channels (separate programme — ACME-PROG-2024-007)
- Account management and servicing capabilities post-activation
- Customer-facing self-service portal redesign (separate UX programme)

**Constraints:**

| ID | Constraint | Type | Confidence |
|----|------------|------|------------|
| C-01 | Programme budget ≤ €12M capex over 3 years | Hard budget ceiling | `[proven]` / one-way door |
| C-02 | Phase A complete by 2025-01-31; Phase B complete by 2025-04-30 | Timeline | `[informed estimate]` / two-way door |
| C-03 | All components on ACME approved cloud platform (Technology Standards Register v4.2) | Platform constraint | `[proven]` / two-way door (exceptions via Architecture Board) |
| C-04 | Identity verification must meet the assurance level in the applicable regulatory directive | Regulatory | `[proven]` / one-way door |
| C-05 | Legacy CRM decommission must complete by Q4 2025 (vendor EoL) | Hard deadline | `[proven]` / one-way door |

**Horizon:** H2 — scale emerging. The target architecture is designed for a 3-year horizon; it does not require infrastructure transformation (H3) or is not a short-cycle optimisation (H1).

### 4 — Overview of the Architecture Vision

**Problem statement:** ACME's Customer Onboarding capability is fragmented across 4 disconnected systems, resulting in an 11-day manual cycle, an 18% duplicate-record rate, and a 23% abandonment rate. The current architecture cannot meet the new identity verification regulatory requirement without structural change.

**Vision of the future state:** A cloud-native Customer Onboarding capability where a customer's identity is verified digitally in real time, their data is recorded once in a single authoritative Customer Master Data system, and their account is activated within **3 working days** of application. The architecture adopts managed identity verification and document capture services (Principle A-01), exposes all integrations via documented APIs (Principle T-01), and enforces security at every layer (Principle T-02). The legacy CRM onboarding module is decommissioned by Q4 2025.

**Key architectural decisions required (not yet made):**
- Selection of managed Identity Verification SaaS provider
- Event-driven vs synchronous orchestration pattern for the onboarding workflow
- Cloud region and residency configuration to satisfy Principle D-02

**Business value and success metrics:**

| Metric | Baseline (Q2 2024) | Target | Confidence |
|--------|--------------------|--------|------------|
| Average onboarding cycle | 11 working days | ≤ 3 working days | `[proven]` baseline; `[informed estimate]` target |
| Customer abandonment rate | 23% | ≤ 10% | `[proven]` baseline; `[working hypothesis]` target — dependent on UX programme |
| Duplicate customer record rate | 18% | < 1% | `[proven]` baseline; `[informed estimate]` target |
| Identity verification regulatory compliance | Non-compliant (2024 audit) | Fully compliant at Phase G | `[proven]` |

**Broad Responsibility:** The target architecture processes the personal identity data of every new ACME customer. A failure in identity verification accuracy, data security, or data residency has consequences for individuals beyond ACME's commercial interests — incorrect identity verification can deny legitimate customers access; a data breach exposes them to fraud. `[proven]`

### 5 — Change-of-Scope Procedures

| Trigger event | Initiator | Approver | Process |
|---------------|-----------|----------|---------|
| Scope expansion beyond named in-scope items | Lead Architect (Marcus Webb) | Architecture Sponsor (Sarah Chen) | Formal SoAW revision; Version increment; Architecture Board notification |
| Budget revision > 15% | Programme Manager | Architecture Sponsor + CFO | SoAW revision; constraint table update; Architecture Board review |
| Regulatory change materially affecting C-04 | CISO (David Okafor) | Architecture Sponsor | Emergency SoAW amendment; Principles D-01, D-02 review triggered |
| Key stakeholder change (Architecture Sponsor or Lead Architect) | Programme Board | Programme Board | SoAW countersignature by new role holder; Architecture Board informed |

> [!important]
> An unsigned SoAW revision does not override the current signed version. Scope changes without a signed SoAW revision are not authorised architecture changes — they are scope creep and must be resisted by the Lead Architect.
