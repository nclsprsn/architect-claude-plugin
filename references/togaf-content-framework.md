# TOGAF Architecture Content Framework — Canonical Artefact Reference

Source: TOGAF Standard 10th Edition, Pocket Guide G220 (Josey/Hornford, Van Haren, 2022). Exact counts per phase come from the TOGAF Architecture Content series guide — the Pocket Guide chapter 18 gives representative examples, not an exhaustive enumeration.

Skills that produce phase artefacts should reference this file rather than asserting hard counts inline.

## Phase B — Business Architecture

### Catalogs

| Catalog | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| Business Capabilities Catalog | Hierarchical capability inventory with maturity, ownership, and To-Be target |
| Value Stream Catalog | End-to-end value streams with stages, stakeholders, and lifecycle |

| Role Catalog | Business roles, competencies, and organizational responsibilities |
| Business Service/Function Catalog | Business services and logical functions |
| Location Catalog | Geographic locations, facilities, and business units per location |
| Process/Event/Control/Product Catalog | Business processes, events, controls, and products |
| Contract/Measure Catalog | Service contracts, performance measures, and compliance requirements |

### Matrices

| Matrix | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| Business Interaction Matrix | Dependency and communication between organizations and actors |
| Actor/Role Matrix | Roles each actor/organizational unit undertakes |
| Value Stream/Capability Matrix | Capabilities required per value stream stage |
| Strategy/Capability Matrix | Capabilities required per strategy statement |
| Capability/Organization Matrix | Organizational elements implementing each capability |

### Diagrams

| Diagram | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| Business Footprint Diagram | Business functions → organizational units and locations |
| Business Interaction Diagram | Interactions between organizations |

## Phase C — Data Architecture

### Catalogs

| Catalog | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| Data Entity/Data Component Catalog | Data entities, attributes, relationships, ownership, lineage |

### Matrices

| Matrix | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| Data Entity/Business Function Matrix | Data ownership per business function |
| Application/Data Matrix (System/Data Matrix) | CRUD mapping — which applications access which data |
| Business Service/Information Matrix | Services → data consumed and produced |

### Diagrams

| Diagram | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| Conceptual Data Diagram | High-level data relationships and critical entities (business-focused) |
| Logical Data Diagram | Data entities, attributes, and relationships (platform-independent) |
| Data Dissemination Diagram | How logical data entities are physically realized; replication and distribution |
| Data Security Diagram | Actor → data access rights; GDPR/regulatory compliance |
| Data Migration Diagram | Data flow from source to target applications |
| Data Lifecycle Diagram | Data state changes from creation to disposal; retention policies |

---

## Phase C — Application Architecture

### Catalogs

| Catalog | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| Application Portfolio Catalog | All applications with purpose, decomposition, and status |
| Interface Catalog | All interfaces between applications; mechanism and dependency scope |

### Matrices

| Matrix | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| Application/Organization Matrix | Applications → organizational units |
| Role/Application Matrix | Applications → business roles and access rights |
| Application/Function Matrix | Applications → business functions |
| Application Interaction Matrix | Core application-to-application dependencies |
| Application/Data Matrix | CRUD mapping — which applications own which data |

### Diagrams

| Diagram | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| Application Communication Diagram | Application-to-application interactions and information exchange |
| Application/User Location Diagram | Applications → deployment locations and user geographies |
| Enterprise Manageability Diagram | Management-class software interactions |
| Application Migration Diagram | Application migration sequencing |
| Software Engineering Diagram | Software components and their relationships |
| Application and User Location Diagram | Application deployment geography |

---

## Phase D — Technology Architecture

### Catalogs

| Catalog | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| Technology Portfolio Catalog | Technology components with type, provider, version, lifecycle, owner |
| Technology Standards Catalog | Approved technology standards with versions and refresh cycles |

### Matrices

| Matrix | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| Application/Technology Matrix | Application components → supporting technology components |
| System/Technology Matrix | Systems → technology platforms |

### Diagrams

| Diagram | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| Platform Decomposition Diagram | Technology platform layers and component hierarchy |
| Environments and Locations Diagram | Geographic locations → deployed technologies and applications |
| Networked Computing/Hardware Diagram | Hardware nodes, network interconnections, three-tier layers |
| Communications Engineering Diagram | Communication infrastructure and connectivity between components |
| Processing Diagram | Deployable units, connectivity, protocols, and load requirements |

## Notes

- **"Class Diagram"** is a UML artefact, not a canonical TOGAF Phase C-Data diagram. The TOGAF equivalent is Logical Data Diagram (platform-independent) or Conceptual Data Diagram (business-level).
- Skills must not assert hard counts (e.g., "TOGAF defines N standard catalogs") — the exact count depends on the full TOGAF Architecture Content series guide, which expands on the Pocket Guide. Use "canonical artefacts include the following" instead.
- Maturity scoring (0–4 scale) is a CMMI-derived practitioner overlay — see `scoring-conventions.md`.
