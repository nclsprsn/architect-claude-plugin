## Install

```bash
claude plugin install gh:nclsprsn/architect-claude-plugin
```

## Quick Start

```bash

## Commands

### Discover — understand the landscape

| Command | What it does |
|---------|-------------|
| `/architecture-review [path]` | Chief architect critique: quality attributes, assumption stress-test, disruptive alternative, second-order effects |
| `/gap-analysis [path]` | Baseline → target gap table, scored by domain and effort, sequenced into H1/H2/H3 roadmap |
| `/risk-radar [path]` | Risk heat map × RAID log × top mitigations × one systemic risk worth naming |
| `/data-architecture [path]` | Data quality attributes, topology assessment, GDPR/AI Act check, governance blind spot, second-order effects |
| `/integration-architecture [path]` | Integration quality attributes, topology fitness, contract governance, reliability patterns, anti-pattern detection |
| `/data-pipeline-review [path]` | Pipeline pattern vs SLA fitness, idempotency, lineage, data quality checks, observability assessment |

### Decide — make and record decisions

| Command | What it does |
|---------|-------------|
| `/trade-off-analysis [context]` | Evaluate 2–3 options → clear recommendation → ADR-ready output |
| `/adr-generator [context]` | Write a clean MADR from a decision already made — faster than trade-off-analysis |

### Communicate — land the message

| Command | What it does |
|---------|-------------|
| `/executive-summary [path]` | Rewrite technical doc for C-level: Pyramid Principle, business implications, numbered claims |
| `/stakeholder-communication [path]` | Tailor a communication for a named role: CTO / Head of Eng / CPO / CFO / Procurement / Board |

### Plan — sequence and phase the delivery

| Command | What it does |
|---------|-------------|
| `/migration-plan [path]` | Phase gap-analysis output into a dependency-sequenced H1/H2/H3 roadmap with critical path, quick wins, and TOGAF Transition Architectures |

### Document — create architecture artifacts

| Command | What it does |
|---------|-------------|
| `/new-arch-doc [phase]` | Scaffold a TOGAF phase document (A–D) or framework-agnostic proposal with guiding questions |

## When to Use What

| Situation | Use |
|-----------|-----|
| Starting a new engagement or TOGAF phase | `/new-arch-doc` |
| Reviewing a document or proposal before a review gate | `/architecture-review` |
| Reviewing a data platform, data model, or data governance design | `/data-architecture` |
| Reviewing an API design, event-driven system, or integration layer | `/integration-architecture` |
| Reviewing an ETL/ELT pipeline, streaming design, or data ingestion | `/data-pipeline-review` |
| Mapping current state to target state | `/gap-analysis` |
| Comparing options before committing to a direction | `/trade-off-analysis` |
| Capturing a decision already made | `/adr-generator` |
| Preparing a steerco or executive review deck | `/executive-summary` |
| Writing to a specific stakeholder (CTO, CFO, Board…) | `/stakeholder-communication` |
| Pre-launch, pre-release, or pre-migration risk check | `/risk-radar` |
| Sequencing gap-analysis output into a delivery roadmap | `/migration-plan` |
| Phasing a migration with TOGAF Transition Architectures | `/gap-analysis` → `/migration-plan` |
| Architecture board submission | `/architecture-review` + `/risk-radar` |
| Onboarding a new team to an existing architecture | `/executive-summary` + `/stakeholder-communication` |

### When NOT to Use

- **Detailed implementation planning** — use a dedicated planning tool or write the plan yourself; these skills operate at architecture level, not sprint level
- **Line-by-line code review** — these skills review architecture and design decisions, not code quality or correctness
- **Generating production code** — the skills produce architecture documentation and decision records, not deployable artefacts
- **Replacing stakeholder interviews** — the skills structure your thinking and output; they cannot substitute for domain knowledge or client context that hasn't been provided
- **Lightweight decisions** — don't run `/trade-off-analysis` or `/adr-generator` on a config parameter or a naming convention; the overhead outweighs the value

## Architect Workflow

Most engagements follow one of two tracks depending on whether the system under design integrates operational business processes or builds a decisional / data platform.

---

### Track 1 — Operational SI Engagement

Applies to systems that run business operations: CRM, ERP, order management, API platform, microservices migration. The work moves from vision to delivery roadmap.

## Design Philosophy

### Core Posture

Every skill operates from the same architect mindset:

- **Work backwards** from the business outcome — never forward from the technology
- **Surface a disruptive alternative** that questions whether the problem was framed correctly
- **Name the horizon** — H1 optimise core / H2 scale emerging / H3 seed disruptive
- **Apply the commoditisation curve** — never custom-build a commodity
- **Anchor every claim** with a number or first-principles reasoning
- **Name second-order effects** — at least one non-obvious downstream consequence per output
- **Highest Standards** — every output closes with a client-deliverable quality check

### Output Discipline

Posture without accountability is theatre. Every skill enforces four output rules so recommendations land as decisions, not opinions:

- **Confidence marker** on every claim, score, and recommendation — `[proven]` / `[informed estimate]` / `[working hypothesis]`
- **Reversibility tag** on every decision — **one-way door** (slow, deliberate) or **two-way door** (move fast, learn fast)
- **Named owner + review trigger** on every recommendation, risk, gap, and decision — role + evidence threshold or event, not a calendar date
- **Broad Responsibility line** on every output — societal, environmental, regulatory, or customers-of-customers implication; `N/A — [reason]` only when no plausible downstream impact exists

### TOGAF Default

TOGAF vocabulary (ADM phases, building blocks, gap analysis) is active by default. If your project does not use TOGAF, the skills degrade gracefully to framework-agnostic mode — just don't mention TOGAF in your prompts.

---

## Roadmap

| Skill | What it will do |
|-------|----------------|
| `capability-assessment` | Score architecture maturity across domains against a target capability level |
| `data-mesh-designer` | Generate a data mesh topology design from domain ownership and data product definitions |
| `workshop-facilitator` | Produce a structured workshop agenda + facilitation guide for architecture sessions |
| `rfp-evaluator` | Evaluate vendor RFP responses against a set of architecture requirements |
| `pattern-library` | Suggest architecture patterns and reference architectures from a problem description |

---

## Troubleshooting

**The command runs but the output ignores my TOGAF context.**
Include TOGAF vocabulary in your prompt or document. The skills detect TOGAF signals (ADM phases, building blocks, gap analysis) to switch into full TOGAF mode. If none are present, they fall back to framework-agnostic output.

**The output is too generic — it doesn't reflect my specific architecture.**
Pass the actual document or decision context as input, not a description of it. `/architecture-review docs/platform-design.md` is significantly richer than `/architecture-review our platform uses microservices`.

**`/trade-off-analysis` gives me a tie with no clear winner.**
The skill is designed to produce a recommendation, not a neutral comparison. If you get an undecided output, add a tiebreaker criterion in your prompt: the business constraint, timeline pressure, or team capability that should break the tie.

**The skill doesn't detect TOGAF even though my document uses it.**
Ensure standard TOGAF terms appear in the document: "ADM", "Building Block", "Baseline", "Target Architecture", "Gap Analysis", "Phase A/B/C/D". A document that describes TOGAF intent without using the vocabulary will be treated as framework-agnostic.

**Output is missing the Broad Responsibility line.**
The skill should always emit one. If it outputs `N/A`, it must include a reason. If neither appears, re-run with an explicit reminder: append `-- ensure Broad Responsibility line is present` to your command.
