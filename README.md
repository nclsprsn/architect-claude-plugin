TOGAF-structured architecture outputs in minutes. Twenty-three skills covering the full ADM cycle — from establishing Architecture Principles to governing live implementations — each producing client-ready documents with built-in accountability markers.

---

## Why install it

Every architecture engagement carries a *scaffolding tax*: hours spent formatting a Statement of Architecture Work correctly, constructing a capability catalog with the right maturity evidence, or checking an artifact against all required Catalogs, Matrices, and Diagrams before board submission. That time displaces architectural thinking.

This plugin pays down that tax:

- **TOGAF 10-fidelity templates** — Statement of Architecture Work (§7.6, 9 clauses), Architecture Requirements Specification (§7.11, 9 sections), Architecture Contract (§7.18) — populated, not blank
- **Built-in accountability** — every output carries confidence markers, reversibility tags, named owners, and a Broad Responsibility line; no vague recommendations
- **Staged validation pipeline** — `principles-check → architecture-review → artifact-completeness → compliance-review` — each gate tells you what the next gate needs
- **Skill chaining** — every skill ends with a `## Next Step` block recommending the downstream skill to invoke next
- **Framework-agnostic fallback** — TOGAF vocabulary active by default; omit it and the skills degrade cleanly to framework-agnostic output

If you produce architecture documents, review other people's designs, or sit on an Architecture Board — this is the plugin to install.

## Requirements

- [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code) — CLI or desktop app

**Optional**

- Claude Code VS Code extension — run skills on open files without leaving the editor
- Obsidian (Dataview, Mermaid Tools) — render generated diagrams, query ADRs and decisions as a live register

## ADM Workflow

### Specification Track

From Preliminary through Phase F. Requirements Management runs continuously across all phases. Use `/new-arch-doc` to scaffold a blank phase document before populating it with the phase skills below.

### Validation & Governance Track

From artifact submission through Architecture Board decision, Phase G ongoing monitoring, and Phase H change management. Phase H feeds back to the start of a new ADM cycle.

## Design Philosophy

### Architect Mindset

Every skill operates from the same posture — the same questions an experienced chief architect would ask before signing off an output:

- Work backwards from the business outcome — never forward from the technology
- Surface a disruptive alternative that questions whether the problem was framed correctly
- Name the horizon — H1 optimise core / H2 scale emerging / H3 seed disruptive; flag when an H3 problem gets H1 treatment
- Apply the commoditisation curve — never custom-build a commodity
- Anchor every claim with a number, reference architecture, or first-principles reasoning
- Name at least one second-order effect per output

### Output Accountability

Posture without accountability is theatre. Every skill enforces four output rules so recommendations land as decisions, not opinions:

| Marker | What it enforces |
|--------|-----------------|
| `[proven]` / `[informed estimate]` / `[working hypothesis]` | Calibrates confidence in every claim, score, and recommendation |
| **one-way door** / **two-way door** | Makes reversibility explicit before a decision is committed |
| Named owner + event-based review trigger | Prevents unowned recommendations; no calendar-date triggers |
| Broad Responsibility line | Surfaces societal, regulatory, or downstream impact on every output |

### Skill Chaining

Each skill ends with a `## Next Step` block recommending the downstream skill to invoke — either forward (next ADM phase) or lateral (validation gate, decision capture, or communication). Claude invokes the next skill if your intent is clear; you accept or override the suggestion.

### TOGAF Default

TOGAF vocabulary — ADM phases, building blocks, gap analysis — is active by default. If your project does not use TOGAF, omit the vocabulary in your prompts and the skills degrade to framework-agnostic mode automatically.

---

## Troubleshooting

**The skill runs but the output ignores my TOGAF context.**
Include TOGAF vocabulary in your prompt or document. The skills detect signals (ADM phases, building blocks, gap analysis) to switch into full TOGAF mode. Ensure standard terms appear: "ADM", "Building Block", "Baseline", "Target Architecture", "Phase A/B/C/D".

**The output is too generic.**
Pass the actual document as input, not a description of it. `/architecture-review docs/platform-design.md` is significantly richer than `/architecture-review our platform uses microservices`.

**`/trade-off-analysis` gives me a tie with no clear winner.**
Add a tiebreaker criterion: the business constraint, timeline pressure, or team capability that should break the tie. Append it to your prompt.

**Output is missing the Broad Responsibility line.**
If it outputs `N/A`, it must include a reason. If neither appears, re-run with an explicit reminder: append `-- ensure Broad Responsibility line is present` to your command.

**I don't know which skill to invoke.**
Run `/architect-router` with a short description of what you're trying to do. The router detects ADM phase and intent and recommends the right skill.
